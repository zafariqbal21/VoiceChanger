# Voice Transformation App - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach

**Selected Approach:** Design System - Material Design
**Justification:** As an audio processing utility tool, the interface prioritizes functionality, clear feedback, and intuitive controls over decorative elements. Material Design's emphasis on responsive surfaces, clear affordances, and systematic feedback patterns aligns perfectly with audio workflow requirements.

**Key Design Principles:**
- Clarity over decoration: Every element serves a functional purpose
- Immediate visual feedback for all audio processing states
- Progressive disclosure: Show advanced controls only when needed
- Trust-building through professional presentation

## Core Design Elements

### A. Typography
- **Primary Font:** Inter (Google Fonts)
- **Display/Headers:** 700 weight, 2xl to 4xl sizes
- **Body Text:** 400 weight, base to lg sizes
- **UI Labels:** 500 weight, sm to base sizes
- **Technical Info:** 400 weight, xs to sm sizes (processing status, file info)

### B. Layout System
**Spacing Units:** Consistently use Tailwind units of 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12
- Tight spacing: p-3, gap-3 (within components)
- Standard spacing: p-4, p-6 (component padding)
- Section spacing: p-8, py-12 (between major sections)
- Generous spacing: p-12 (around main content areas)

**Container Strategy:**
- Main app container: max-w-4xl centered
- Upload area: Full width within container
- Control panels: max-w-2xl for optimal control density

### C. Component Library

**1. File Upload Zone**
- Large dropzone area with dashed border treatment
- Drag-and-drop indicator with animated state
- File type icons and accepted format display
- Upload progress bar with percentage indicator
- File info card displaying name, size, duration

**2. Audio Visualization**
- Waveform display showing audio amplitude
- Playback scrubber for navigation
- Time indicators (current/total duration)
- Play/Pause controls with clear iconography

**3. Gender Transformation Controls**
- Primary control: Slider with labeled endpoints ("Masculine" â†” "Feminine")
- Preset buttons for quick selection (Male Voice, Neutral, Female Voice)
- Fine-tune controls revealed on advanced toggle
- Real-time preview button
- Reset to original button

**4. Processing Feedback**
- Processing animation with status text
- Progress indicator showing transformation stages
- Success confirmation with preview option
- Error states with clear messaging and retry action

**5. Output Section**
- Comparison player (original vs. transformed side-by-side)
- Download button (primary CTA)
- Share options (if applicable)
- New transformation button to start over

**6. Navigation & Header**
- App logo/title on left
- Help/info icon on right
- Minimal navigation (focus on single-task workflow)

## Page Structure

**Single-Page Application Layout:**

1. **Header Section** (h-16)
   - Sticky top navigation
   - App branding and subtitle
   - Help/support link

2. **Hero/Introduction** (py-12)
   - Compelling headline: "Transform Your Voice with AI"
   - Subheadline explaining gender transformation capability
   - Visual representation of audio transformation
   - Quick feature highlights (Fast Processing, High Quality, Privacy-First)

3. **Main Workflow Area** (py-8)
   
   **State 1 - Upload (Default):**
   - Prominent upload dropzone (min-h-64)
   - Supported formats list
   - Sample audio link for testing
   
   **State 2 - Processing:**
   - Uploaded file card
   - Waveform visualization
   - Transformation controls panel
   - Process button (primary, full-width)
   
   **State 3 - Result:**
   - Before/After comparison section
   - Download and sharing options
   - Start new transformation button

4. **How It Works Section** (py-12)
   - Three-step process visualization
   - Icon + title + description cards
   - Build trust and set expectations

5. **Footer** (py-8)

## Images

**Hero Image:** Yes - Central visual element
- Description: Abstract visualization of audio waveforms transforming, showing frequency spectrum with gradient transitions representing voice transformation
- Placement: Full-width background treatment behind hero text, subtle overlay for text legibility
- Treatment: Gradient overlay to ensure text contrast

**Additional Images:**
- Feature icons throughout (use Heroicons via CDN)
- Waveform visualizations (generated dynamically from audio)
- Processing animation graphics (abstract geometric patterns suggesting transformation)

## Interaction Patterns

**Upload Flow:**
- Drag-and-drop primary, click-to-browse secondary
- Instant file validation with clear error messages
- Smooth transition from upload to processing state

**Audio Controls:**
- Standard playback patterns (space to play/pause)
- Scrubber drag interaction with snap-to behavior
- Volume control accessible but not prominent

**Transformation Slider:**
- Smooth dragging with live preview option
- Haptic-style stops at preset positions
- Visual feedback showing transformation intensity

**Processing States:**
- Loading spinner with descriptive status text
- Estimated time remaining
- Cannot interrupt once started (with clear messaging)

## Accessibility & Quality Standards

- Keyboard navigation for all controls
- ARIA labels for audio players and sliders
- Clear focus indicators on all interactive elements
- Error messages with actionable guidance
- Sufficient contrast ratios throughout
- Semantic HTML structure for screen readers

**Performance Considerations:**
- Lazy load waveform visualizations
- Optimize audio file handling
- Progressive enhancement for advanced features
- Clear feedback during processing delays
